# prisma-apollo-exampledb
That was a pain Dx
This is a boilerplate I created for myself. Feel free to use if you'd like!

### Bash Commands:
```sh
$ graphql get-schema (to make prisma schema if you made any changes to either schemas) 
$ prisma deploy (if you make any changes to prisma datamodel) 
$ node src/index.js (to start apollo/prisma server) 
```
